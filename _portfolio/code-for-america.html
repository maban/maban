<p>The brief was to overhaul the Code for America wesbite and deliver a system of modular, responsive components.</p>

<p>The components needed to be flexible enough that they could be assembled in different combinations so voluteers can build their own templates as Code for America expands.</p>

<p>The markup needed to be minimal, forgiving, and well documented, as people with a range of technical abilities would be creating their own pages.</p>
