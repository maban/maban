<p>Mozilla approached Clearleft to redesign the Firefox Addons site, which serves 2 million people per day. The site was built in a modular and well-documented way so that Mozilla's team of voluteers could implement it.</p>

<p>Paul Lloyd and Richard Rutter worked on the design, and I pair-programmed with Natalie Downe on the HTML and CSS.</p>

<p>Mozilla reported a 20% increase in traffic to the add-ons site after the new version went live.</p>
