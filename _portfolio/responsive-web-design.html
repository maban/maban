<p>I was incredibly humbled to be asked to tech edit Ethan Marcotte's second edition of Responsive Web Design.</p>

<p>My first task was to re-read and made notes on what could be updated from the first edition, which I handed to Ethan to work into the second edition. I then reviewed his drafts and checked the code, giving further feedback along the way.</p>

<p>I thouroughly enjoyed working with A Book Apart, and I hope they ask me to tech edit more of their titles!</p>
