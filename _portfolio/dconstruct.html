<p>While interning with Clearleft, I was tasked with building the site for the upcoming dConstruct conference, pair programming with <a href="https://twitter.com/natbat">Natalie Downe</a>.</p>

<p>I learnt a lot from this project, as my work was reviewed by <a href="https://twitter.com/adactio">Jeremy Keith who was keen for me to use <a href="https://microformats.org/">Microformats</a>. While we didn't use HTML5, the classnames given to various elements mirrored HTML5 element names.</p>

<p>I remember the trickiest part of the site to build was the navigation, which was a green ribbon that folded on its active page. This had to be flexible enough to expand horizontally to fit the length of text in the navigation item, and vertically when the font-size changed.</p>
