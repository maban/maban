      <p>This book is great for web designers who work closely with developers. It will give you a good idea on what elements need to be designed, even if you aren’t writing the code. And, if you want to dip your toe into writing CSS, I think creating a style guide is a perfect, and practical place to start.</p>

      <p>Really good read. There are some great links to resources on how to get started with your own style guide. I will be coming back to this title many times for reference and inspiration.</p>

      <p>Establishing a style guide / pattern portfolio can induce some up-front pain but can potentially save you so much more pain, time and money in the long term. This eBook quickly got me on the right path. Helpful and informative, but also a joy to read. Highly recommended.</p>

      <p>I just recently began researching style guide frameworks and practices. This book couldn't have come out at a better time for me. It reinforced a lot of what I've learned and gave me a lot more to think about. I'll definitely be using some of what I learned here as I build out a boilerplate style guide for my projects. Great pocket guide.</p>

      <p>Ideal for someone having a first try at this sort of thing and the detail the author goes into about the different types of style guide that you can create quite helped me redefine mine.</p>
      <p>I also enjoyed the vast amount of amazing resources Anna offers links to - all of which I had to leave the book for a good while and pore over, before heading back to the book of course!</p>

      <p>As a seasoned designer with lots of experience working with—and writing—more traditional brand guidelines for print and web this all made great sense and will be a great reference to have. I wasn't previously familiar with "Front-end Style Guides" in the sense live-code "living" documents.</p>
      <p>Can absolutely see this as a must-have primer on the topic for the fresh-out-of-school designers out there.</p>
