      <p>This pack is designed to spark valuable conversations during product planning. Each card is a prompt for a consideration about scale, design, security, development, or marketing. You can <a href="/107">read more about how this came about on my blog</a>.</p>

      <p>A lot of people have asked for a physical pack of these. I originally got a small run printed through a business card company, but selling and shipping a physical product to different countries is challenging. Instead, I'm making the contents available so you can print your own at home. With so many teams working distributed, you'll probably find the digital version more useful, as you'll be able to share the prompts as slides on a screen, or even export them to a collaborative whiteboard.</p>

      <p>I'm sure you'll want to add your own items, which is why I've included some blank cards at the end.</p>
