        <p>I've been working for myself since 2008. During that time, I've had the opportunity to help work on the front-end code of some incredible projects with <a href="/portfolio/dconstruct/">Clearleft</a>, <a href="/portfolio/mosaic/">The Wellcome Trust</a>, <a href="/portfolio/idap/">Government Digital Service</a>, <a href="/portfolio/code-for-america/">Code for America</a>, <a href="/portfolio/university-of-surrey/">The University of Surrey</a>, <a href="/portfolio/">and many more</a>.</p>

        <p>I've written a book about <a href="">Front-end style guides</a>, and I give talks around the world about best practices in web development.</p>

        <p>In 2013, I was awarded <a href="https://thenetawards.com/previous-winners/">Netmag's Young Developer of the Year</a>.</p>

        <p>I'll often work with in-house teams on agile projects that need a round of rapid prototyping followed by production-quality code. I prefer to be ingrained with a team, working in the same room as them, rather than working off-site. Where that's not possible (such as if a client is based abroad), I'll arrange a daily standup with the team to feed back what I've worked on that day, ask any questions, and make sure things are on track.</p>

        <p>I work closely with the designers and back-end developers to ensure the project's vision is maintained through the different work streams. When I work directly with the designer, they'll often only need to give me very low-fidelity wireframes (usually just a series of rectangles and scribbles on a piece of paper), skipping the photoshop phase. I can quickly turn these into functioning prototypes which I iterate on with the designer.</p>

        <p>While I'm happy to pitch in with some of the design work alongside a designer and have a decent eye for typography, I am not a designer and I won't be comfortable working on aspects such as mockups or iconography. A lot of people assume I'm a designer, which I find flattering, but I'm absolutely not one!</p>

        <p>When I work with an agency, I expect full autonomy with the client, and I don't agree with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-label_product">whitelabelling</a> my services. It doesn't feel right to me and I'm not very good at pretending.</p>

        <p>I'm confident using <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> (and <a href="https://github.com/maban">GitHub</a>) for version control, build systems including <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> and <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a>, project planning tools such as <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">Jira</a> and <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a>, and templating systems such as <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.</p>

        <p>As well as working with clients on websites, I also do tech editing for publications. I'm on the team at <a href="http://alistapart.com/">A List Apart</a> and <a href="https://24ways.org/">24 ways</a> as a tech editor, and I was <a href="http://ethanmarcotte.com/">Ethan Marcotte</a>'s tech editor for the second edition of his book <a href="/portfolio/responsive-web-design/">Responsive Web Design</a>. I'm currently tech-editing two titles that have yet to be released.</p>

        <p>I tech edit work that's still in the outline phase, and also work that's nearly ready to publish.</p>

        <p>When I'm sent a piece to tech edit, the main thing I do is check that what's being said is correct to the best of my knowledge. I'll test any code in different browsers, and also add comments where I think something needs to be explained more fully.</p>

        <p>Unlike a copy editor, I won't correct spelling or gramatical mistakes, nor will I do line-edits, but I'll often act as a second pair of eyes and flag things that I want the copy editor to look at.</p>

        <p>I've given over a dozen talks around the world about the things I'm passionate about. When I give a talk, I try and tailor it to the event, so it's really great if you can tell me a bit about your audience beforehand (Is English their first language? Are they mainly designers/developers? Are they at the start of their careers?).</p>

        <p>These are the topics I'm currently speaking about:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><a href="/speaking/game-console-browsers/">Game console browsers</a></li>
          <li><a href="/speaking/front-end-style-guides/">Front-end Style Guides</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>I live in London, 10 minutes from the Underground, 30 minutes from the Eurostar, and under and hour to the nearest airport, so it's pretty easy for me to get around. I'm also confident using public transport, and usually prefer that to a taxi.</p>

        <p>I'm highly conscious of the need for conferences and meetups to offer a safe space for speakers and attendees, so I only speak at events that have a published and enforced <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/tweaking-the-moral-ui">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
