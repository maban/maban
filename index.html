  <h2>About me</h2>

  <div class="lede">

    <p>Hi! I'm Anna, Director of Product at <a href="http://snyk.io">Snyk</a> in London in the UK. Before that, I was a Front-end Developer. In 2013, I was awarded <a href="https://thenetawards.com/previous-winners/">Netmag's Young Developer of the Year</a>.</p>

    <p>In 2015, I co-hosted a small-batch podcast with Brad Frost on Front-end Style Guides, and <a href="/projects/front-end-style-guides/">I've written a book on the topic</a>. I'm also interested in the browsers on various game consoles, and <a href="http://console.maban.co.uk/">I've made a site documenting these</a>.</p>

    <p>I was a Technical Editor for <a href="http://alistapart.com/">A List Apart</a>, and Technical Editor of <a href="http://abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design">the second edition of Ethan Marcotte's <cite>Responsive Web Design</cite></a>.</p>

    <p>Every December, I co-produce <a href="http://24ways.org/">24 Ways</a>.</p>
