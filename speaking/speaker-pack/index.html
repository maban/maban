    <ul>
      <li>You will pay for any flights and hotel fees in advance of the event.</li>
      <li>If your event is based outside of the EU, you will arrange for a visa for me to speak.</li>
      <li>For my talk, I will use my own computer to control the slides. I will require my speaker notes to be visible to me during the talk.</li>
      <li>I will not provide my slide deck in advance of the event because I am likely to make changes to it right before I speak, but I am happy to provide a link to my slides to attendees after the event.</li>
      <li>Any footage recorded must not be sold without my permission after the event, this will require a separate agreement.</li>
      <li>I will invoice you my fee after the event. The invoice must be paid in full in GBP within 14 days of receipt.</li>
