    <h2>My expectations of you</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="article">
    <p>In order to deliver the best experience to attendees, there are a few things I ask of you as an organiser so that I can focus fully on my talk.</p>
    <p>First, if I need to travel, you will need to arrange for a visa for me to speak, and also for flights and hotel fees to be paid in advance of the event.</p>
    <p>During the talk, I ask that you allow me to use my own computer to control the slides and view my notes. Any footage recorded must not be sold without my permission after the event â€“ this will require a separate agreement. Happy for it to be made available for free under a creative commons license though.</p>
    <p>I will invoice you for my fee and any agreed expenses after the event. My invoice terms are 14 days, payable in GBP.</p>

    <h2>Travel</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="article">

    <p>I live in London, 10 minutes from the Underground, 30 minutes from the Eurostar, and under an hour to the nearest airport, so it's pretty easy for me to get around. I'm also confident using public transport, and usually prefer that to a taxi.</p>

    <h3>My closest airports</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Heathrow</li>
      <li>Gatwick</li>
      <li>London City</li>
    </ul>
