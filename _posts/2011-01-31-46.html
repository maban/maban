<p>Last Friday, I had to confront two of my biggest fears simultaneously; public speaking and heights.</p>

<p>I was giving a talk at <a href="https://lanyrd.com/2011/heartandsole/">Heart and Sole</a>, an evening event at <a href="https://www.spinnakertower.co.uk/">Portsmouth&#8217;s Spinnaker Tower</a>, about starting out in the industry. I travelled down with <a href="https://joshemerson.co.uk/">Josh Emerson</a>, who works at <a href="https://clearleft.com/">Clearleft</a> and was able to give me an informal tour of Portsmouth.</p>

<p>The attendees seemed to mostly be students, with a few people who worked at or ran agencies. It was a 2-track event which, considering the ticket price was under &pound;20, was excellent value for money.</p>

<p>I knew a lot of people in the audience were starting out in the industry or considering going freelance, so I wanted to give them a head-start on some of the things that I would have wanted to know when I left school. A few of the things I talked about included writing contracts, sorting out finances and dealing with clients.</p>

<p>I used the video game &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_%28series%29">Fallout</a>&#8220; as the theme to my talk, comparing survival in a post-nuclear wasteland to starting out during a recession.</p>

<p>I think it went ok, it&#8217;s hard to tell what people are thinking, and a lot of the topics (tax, contracts, break-even points and <span class="caps">ISA</span>s) are quite boring, but I didn&#8217;t hear any snoring so I deem that a success.</p>

<p>It was strange giving the talk 100 metres in the air, and even more disconcerting doing it right next to a glass floor. Still, despite it being a very odd experience, it was really good fun and once I&#8217;d got over how scary the whole thing was, I was able to get into character and even enjoy the view.</p>

<p>After I&#8217;d done my thing, <a href="https://www.sydlawrence.com/">Syd Lawrence</a> gave an entertaining talk on &#8220;<a href="https://lanyrd.com/2011/heartandsole/scbpz/">Making <span class="caps">AJAX</span> user friendly, Google friendly, friendly friendly using the History <span class="caps">API</span></a>&#8220;. It was light-hearted and even though it went quite in-depth, he explained things in such a way that my eyes didn&#8217;t glaze over the whole way through. Pretty slides too.</p>

<p>We then headed downstairs to see a couple of short sponsor talks. Unfortunately as the venue is quite small, a few of us had to stand, but considering the low priced tickets and the fact that the organisers were doing this for the first time, this wasn&#8217;t an issue and I didn&#8217;t hear anyone complain.</p>

<p>I was expecting something dry and corporate from the sponsors, but both talks were intelligent and useful to the audience. In fact, if they hadn&#8217;t been labeled &#8220;sponsor talks&#8221; on the schedule, I wouldn&#8217;t have twigged they were anything different from the other talks. I particularly enjoyed the one from the guy at <a href="https://www.strawberrysoup.co.uk/">Strawberry Soup</a> who talked about <a href="https://lanyrd.com/2011/heartandsole/scfxy/">lessons learnt from starting a web design agency</a> (from a couple of people in a shed in the garden, to a company that sounds like is doing pretty well and hiring lots of people). I was worried a lot of content would overlap with mine, but it led on really nicely and it was good having someone else rebuff things I was saying about contracts and charging.</p>

<p>Next up was <a href="https://icant.co.uk/">Christian Heilmann</a> who captivated the whole audience with his talk on <a href="https://lanyrd.com/2011/heartandsole/sccfh/">building a better web</a>. He was able to reflect on some of the mistakes developers made in the late 90s, and how we may be making the same mistakes.</p>

<p>The rest of the evening went very quickly and was a bit of a blur. I did finally get to speak with <a href="https://rawkes.com/">Rob Hawkes</a> after missing his <a href="https://lanyrd.com/2011/heartandsole/szpm/">talk on HTML5 Canvas</a> (some idiot was speaking at the same time as him) and a bunch of other cool people. The organisers are planning something for the Summer so I&#8217;m looking forward to hearing more about that.</p>

<p>The whole event was filmed, so I&#8217;m hoping to be able to add a link to a video of my talk shortly.</p>
