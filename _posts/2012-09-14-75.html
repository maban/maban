title: Console browser testing
---

<p>After writing about the <a href="https://www.maban.co.uk/73">Nintendo DSi browser</a> in July, I began exploring more of the game console browser landscape. I wrote to A List Apart to ask if they'd be interested in running a piece on it, and they said yes. On Tuesday, <a href="https://www.alistapart.com/articles/testing-websites-in-game-console-browsers/">that article was published</a>.</p>

<h2>Getting the consoles</h2>

<p>I set aside a budget of £500 and aimed to get the widest range of devices rather than the most devices possible. I leaned towards the newest models to get an idea of what people are using now and over the next couple of years.</p>

<ul>
<li>I'd already bought a second hand DSi which was cheap because it wasn't in great condition and missing the stylus, but it was perfect for me.</li>
<li>I already had a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ps3">PS3</a>, and it was a good device to test sites with using a conventional controller.</li>
<li><a href="https://aralbalkan.com/">Aral</a> very kindly lent me his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii">Wii</a> (although these are selling for around £40 second hand).</li>
<li>I bought a second hand <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ps_vita">PS Vita</a> which I was able to get relatively cheaply because the screen had a dead pixel. This device comes in two flavours; wifi and wifi+3G, so I guessed people are buying it for its internet capabilities.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xperia_play">Xperia Play</a> was a good way to test what it was like using a phone/console hybrid. In hindsight, I don't think it was that good a choice because it's so similar to a phone, but it was useful for comparison.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3DS_XL#Nintendo_3DS_XL">3DSXL</a> was about to come out and I wanted to see what using a 3D screen was like and it has a different browser to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_dsi">DSi</a>, so I ordered one of those. This was the most expensive device because I had to order it new. I could have bought a smaller, cheaper <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_3DS">3DS model</a>, but I wanted to test the larger screens. It doesn't come with a power adaptor which is annoying, so I had to buy this separately.</li>
</ul>

<p>It might seem excessive to spend this much on testing devices, but I am doing a lot of research with them. I can also claim them as a business expense because I'm not doing anything fun with them (I don't even have games for them). I also keep them in <a href="https://clearleft.com/testlab/">Clearleft's test lab</a> so other people can benefit from using them.</p>

<h2>Writing the article</h2>

<p>The article took 2 months to write in my free time. I spent the first month doing research, sometimes taking the portable consoles round with me for the day to see what they were like to properly use. I also read a lot of articles and reports, trying to find out how many people had a console, what demographics used each one, and specifically, how many used the browsers in them. I didn't think I would be able to find any data on the latter, but at the end of the first month, I found 2 separate sources from <a href="https://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/market-data-research/market-data/communications-market-reports/cmr12/internet-web/uk-4.22">Ofcom</a> and <a href="https://pewinternet.org/Reports/2010/Social-Media-and-Young-Adults/Part-2/5-Wireless.aspx">Pew Internet</a>, and overall the numbers were much higher than I'd expected.</p>

<p>I spent half of the second month gathering my notes into something vaguely readable, and the other half working with the editor, <a href="https://twitter.com/sara_ann_marie">Sara</a>, who was so encouraging and did such an amazing job that I never want to write anything again without her input.</p>

<p>I found out there would be a big Wii U announcement on the 13th, which fitted in nicely with my article due to be published on the 11th. I spent the days leading up to this worrying that there would be new information but it would be too late to put in.</p>

<p>I'm so relieved now the article is out. It was definitely the most challenging thing I've written and I was so happy with the response. I'm also looking forward to sharing more of what I've learnt about console browsers. There was a huge amount I couldn't fit in the article.</p>
