<p>I've got an Evernote notebook full of the results of various tests I ran on game console browsers in preparation for my A List Apart article, and I'm currently working on <a href="http://console.maban.co.uk/">a little site that makes these notes public</a>.</p>

<p>There's not a huge amount of stuff in there yet and it's very rough, but I'll be adding more as I go. I'm recording things like the functions different buttons have in the browser, and what features are supported.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to when the Wii U comes out, and IE9 for the Xbox. There should be a lot more interesting stuff to add then.</p>
