title: Innocent Smoothies

<p>A lot of the clients I work with who have just set up a web presence for their company think it&#8217;s a good idea to start a mailing list and a blog.  Everyone else is doing it, so why shouldn&#8217;t they?  The problem is, so few companies get it right and very few people will bother to read them.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re like me, there are very few corporate mailing lists you willingly subscribe to.  They&#8217;re just so boring and salesy.<br />
The Innocent Smoothie website is one of the few companies that I think get their corporate blog spot on.  Even though I rarely buy their drinks (too expensive for me), I still enjoy reading it.</p>

<h2>They&#8217;re real people</h2>

<p>The blog talks about real people who work in the company, <a href="http://innocentdrinks.typepad.com/innocent_drinks/2009/08/money-money-money.html">like Alison, Ben, Ryan, James and Denym from Finance</a>.  You can tell that the people who work there have a really fun time.  By putting up photos and quotes from each of the team, it gives the company a human touch and makes it seem more friendly and approachable.  They even put up photos of company events, like their <a href="http://innocentdrinks.typepad.com/innocent_drinks/2009/08/sports-day-innocent-style.html">sports day</a>.</p>

<blockquote>And the shortest shorts competition was fearsome. And frightening. Fearsomely frightening.</blockquote>

<h2>Fun copy</h2>

<p>Their copy is colloquial, light-hearted and self-deprecating at times.  Here&#8217;s an excerpt from their knitted hat of the week&#8221; award.<br />
<blockquote>Without further ado. The winner is&#8230;&#8230;weirdly long pause&#8230;fumble with envelope&#8230;Big Bee Hive by Kerri from Essex.</blockquote></p>

<h2>They don&#8217;t just talk about carrots</h2>

<p>The blog has stories on the sorts of things that people working in an office might talk about.  Like <a href="http://innocentdrinks.typepad.com/innocent_drinks/2009/08/the-crust-of-the-matter.html">what do you call the crust at the end of a loaf of bread</a>?  At the end of the article, they add &#8220;Tell us what you call the thick-bit-of-bread-at-the-end-of-the-loaf and the best name will win a breadbin full of smoothies and some toast (lightly buttered).&#8221;  This encourages people to add comments, which is always good on a company blog.<br />
At the end of their mailing list, they have some fun, unrelated links that people have sent in, like Youtube videos.</p>

<h2>They are generous</h2>

<p>As well as offering money-off vouchers to people who subscribe to their mailing list, Innocent also reward customers who write to them with suggestions.<br />

<blockquote>Back in April when we launched our first ever banana free recipe &#8211; kiwis, apples and limes &#8211; we got in touch with everyone who&#8217;d ever written, emailed or called to ask us to make a smoothie without bananas and sent them a free voucher to have a bottle on us.</blockquote></p>

<h2>Useful information</h2>

<p>Dr Shilpee is a regular writer on the Innocent blog, and she answers questions people send in about health matters and adds recipes.  A bit like an agony aunt in a magazine.  She adds credibility to the blog, as well as giving useful titbits of information.</p>

<h2>Lots of photos</h2>

<p>The photos the staff upload to the blog are rarely cheesy stock ones.  They take pictures of their staff, customers and even <a href="http://innocentdrinks.typepad.com/innocent_drinks/2007/05/new_labels.html">sketches of new concepts and artwork.</a></p>

<p>However, it&#8217;s worth bearing in mind this sort of fun approach <a href="http://innocentdrinks.typepad.com/innocent_drinks/2007/05/new_labels.html?cid=69780450#comment-6a00d83451ba8c69e200d8352c487e53ef">doesn&#8217;t appeal to everyone</a>.

<blockquote>I have never read such awful label copy in my life. What are you on at Innocent. Do you really think this is funny and appeals to &#8216;normal people&#8217;. You have gone one step too far!!</blockquote></p>
