<p>A few months ago, I was asked by the head of the Spanish department at my school whether I could make a preloader for some Flash audio lessons he&#8217;d made.  I guess word must have got round the staff room that I knew a bit about the software!  He explained that he ran a website called Proidiomas teaching people who speak Spanish how to speak English.  After sending him the functioning preloader, he asked me to do some other projects including making a Flash game and redesigning his website.  So here&#8217;s how it went&#8230;</p>

<h2>CD case design</h2>

<p>Some of the audio lessons are available for download on my client&#8217;s website, and the full set are available on a CD.  He didn&#8217;t have any specific preferences for how it should look, but simply needed the design to look &#8216;professional and modern&#8217;.  I had a look at other English language websites and CDs, most of which seemed to have London landmarks like Big Ben and red telephone boxes.  I chose a picture of the London Eye because it is a modern landmark and an interesting shape.</p>

<p>Above is an image of the disc design.  I chose to use blue and silver as the branding, and a sans serif font because of the modern and professional connotations.</p>
