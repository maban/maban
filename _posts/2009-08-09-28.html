title: A Teenager's Guide to Effective Freelancing
---

<p>Yesterday, I gave a talk at a web conference called <a href="https://tomorrowswebconf.com/">Tomorrow&#8217;s Web</a>.  I gave a <a href="https://maban.co.uk/index.php/2009/08/08/tomorrows-web/">summary of some of the conference talks here</a>.</p>

<p>The reason I did this talk is because I am concerned that young web designers and developers are jumping into freelancing without much thought, and then discovering how much of a minefield it can be.  So I decided to cover things like how to set up, what sort of problems young freelancers come across, and what I&#8217;ve learned from the mistakes I&#8217;ve made.  I hope you find it useful.</p>

<p>Big thanks to <a href="https://grabaperch.com/">Perch</a> and <a href="https://www.realmacsoftware.com/littlesnapper/">Littlesnapper</a> who provided me with prizes to give out to people who stayed awake during the talk.</p>
