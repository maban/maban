title: The Gentlewoman
---

<p>Way back in November, I got an email from a magazine saying I&#8217;d been recommended for an interview. As I skim-read the message on my phone, I assumed it was for a job.  Although, I thought it was a bit strange that they were asking for my age and a full length portrait.</p>

<p>I sent back a response with details of what I&#8217;d been working on, and attached a rather hideous photo of myself mid-ramble at a conference. I didn&#8217;t expect to hear anything back, but a few days later I got a smart-looking magazine through my door and an email arranging a date with a photographer, writer and a stylist.</p>

<p>The magazine, named <a href="https://www.thegentlewoman.com/">The Gentlewoman</a>, had just published its second issue. It looked very stylish. The cover had a matte feel, almost like leather, the headings were in Futura against big photographs. There were interviews with women including Yoko Ono, and at the back of each issue, a feature on a &#8220;young gentlewoman&#8221;.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&#8220;The Gentlewoman is a new biannual style magazine for a new decade. Featuring inspirational,
international women, it pairs ambitious journalism with a sartorial and intelligent perspective on fashion that is focused on personal style &mdash; the way women actually look, think and dress.&#8221;</p>

<p>Anyone who knows me well will appreciate that I&#8217;m a bit of a disaster area when it comes to fashion. There&#8217;s not a lot that stresses me out more than shopping for clothes, especially shoes, and I apply makeup like a 4-year-old on a sugar high. Being a developer and working from home means I don&#8217;t have to worry about looking nice. So someone asking to put me in a physical copy of a high-brow magazine felt very bizarre.</p>

<p>Yet here it is.</p>

<p>I was photographed by Clare Shilland, my stylist was Beth Fenton, Annabel Callum did my makeup and the text was written by Katrina Dodd.</p>

<p>We did 2 shoots altogether; one in a studio in London (in the snow), and one in my flat and on the streets of Brighton. I had my hair and makeup done, and Beth picked me out a gorgeous Dolce &amp; Gabbana skirt suit, as well as a lovely pair of heels (which you can&#8217;t see in the shot). We rearranged the furniture in my flat, pushing the sofa up against the white wall, taking advantage of the natural light from windows.</p>

<p>It was surprisingly hard work. I was pinned into my clothes so they&#8217;d fit properly, and holding positions without looking tense wasn&#8217;t easy.</p>

<p>After doing a few rolls of film indoors (no digital here), we headed outside. It was freezing and I walk like C-3PO when I&#8217;m wearing heels, even when my skirt isn&#8217;t pinned up. Clare took a few more photos, and the girls kindly wrapped me in my coat every time the sun went in.</p>

<p>Eventually I had to change back into my geek uniform and get back to my code.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been waiting for my copy of the magazine with nervous excitement. It will probably arrive on my doorstep while I&#8217;m visiting the States, but I&#8217;ve been sent a preview of the article while it&#8217;s being posted. I still can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m in a magazine that&#8217;s featured Yoko Ono and Adele Adkins, and that I can pick it up at a newsstand when I visit New York later this month.</p>

<p>Its definitely changed my attitude to fashion. I&#8217;m making a bit more of an effort with clothes, I even bought a pair of heels. And wore them. My makeup bag has makeup in it now, although I&#8217;m still pulling on my hoodie and slippers when I&#8217;m working from home. And no, I couldn&#8217;t keep the suit, but the fact I&#8217;d worn it was enough. To a developer anyway.</p>
