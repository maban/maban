<p>Today I got the news I thought I'd have to wait a lot longer for. The Education Secretary is announcing that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-16493929">ICT in schools is to be replaced by a computer science and programming curriculum</a>.</p>

<p>Back in September, <a href="http://youtu.be/UvM40o734VM">I gave a talk at Update</a> titled <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2011/updateconf/sggxw/">The Digital Native</a>, about what students are taught about IT at school. (Coincidently, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9675000/9675420.stm">Ian Livingstone gave a BBC interview today on the same subject</a>)</p>

<p>It's a topic that has been close to my heart because I studied this curriculum. It's as bad as everyone says it is and it's turning people off the industry. <a href="http://maban.co.uk/47">I've been campaigning to retain the teaching of some form of computing in schools</a> since <a href="http://royalsociety.org/Current-ICT-and-Computer-Science-in-schools/">learning of its demise</a> two years ago.</p>

<p>In May last year, <a href="http://maban.co.uk/56">I won a competition to attend Google Zeitgeist conference</a> after submitting a video to them about the state of IT in schools, and I was encouraged to talk to the people there about this. Eric Schmidt was there, and while I doubt he ever heard my message or saw that video, I was delighted when <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/aug/26/eric-schmidt-chairman-google-education">he brought the topic up at a conference in August</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>"I was flabbergasted to learn that today computer science isn't even taught as standard in UK schools&hellip; Your IT curriculum focuses on teaching how to use software, but gives no insight into how it's made."</p>
	<p><cite>Eric Schmidt</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>David Cameron responded, saying Eric was right and that the country wasn't doing enough.</p>

<p>Now positive change is actually happening, and computing is finally being recognised as a vital subject. While a lot hangs on the implementation (there's an engaging curriculum to write and a lot of teachers to train), I think it's the best news we could have hoped for.</p>

<h2>What next?</h2>

<p>There's a consultation phase starting next week on the new curriculum, and I'm going to <a href="http://maban.co.uk/50">get in touch with Naace again</a> to see if they're contributing to this and find out if there's anything our community can do. I'll keep you posted.</p>
