title: Business Disasters
---

<p>In <a href="https://unfinished.bz/21">this week's episode of Unfinished Business</a>, I talk with Andy about business disasters, and we share some of our experiences.</p>

<p>I've not had one massive disaster, but most of the little disasters I encountered, I could have avoided. Making mistakes is part and parcel of running a business, the important thing is how you respond.</p>

<p>I'd like to encourage others to share some of their mistakes, so here's my list and what I did to make sure I didn't make that mistake again:</p>

<h2>Undercharging</h2>

<p><strong>Mistake:</strong> When I started out, I was charging very little because I was worried potential clients would say I'm too expensive and I'd not getting any work. I was working very long hours and found it difficult to cover living expenses.</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> I increased my rate. I looked at working on different types of projects and switched from working on websites on my own to contracting on longer-term projects which felt more stable.</p>

<h2>Projects going over budget</h2>

<p><strong>Mistake:</strong> Projects were going over time and budget. I wasn't keeping track of my time, so my estimation for the next project wasn't accurate. I could have earned more working somewhere at minimum wage.</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> I got really strict about keeping track of time. I used <a href="https://fuelcollective.com/eon">timekeeping apps</a> that integrated with <a href="https://www.freeagent.com/">FreeAgent</a>. I also started estimating 25% more time than I thought I needed. That way I could either meet or exceed expectations.</p>

<h2>Last minute rush to get taxes filed</h2>

<p><strong>Mistake:</strong> I would leave my accounting until the last minute and have a really stressful few days trying to get everything ready to send to my accountant.</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Now I update my accounts every Friday morning. This also means I'm better at keeping on top of when invoices are due. Freeagent has a <a href="https://www.freeagent.com/support/kb/tax/tax-timeline-feed">tax timeline</a> which helps me see what's coming.</p>

<h2>No payment agreement</h2>

<p><strong>Mistake:</strong> I had a client take 2 years to pay me after I'd launched the site. I didn't take a deposit, I had no contract, and I didn't ask for payment until after the site had launched.</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> I now ask for a deposit, contract, and payment before I launch the site. I have <a href="https://www.freeagent.com/central/invoice-reminder-and-thank-you-emails">automated reminders</a> that are sent out every few days if an invoice is overdue.</p>

<h2>No communication with the designer</h2>

<p><strong>Mistake:</strong> When I worked for agencies who were acting as middlemen, they'd sometimes send me a couple of static photoshop mockups of a site their client wanted built that just didn't work for the web, and I'd have to find a way to make it responsive. There were very rarely any styles for basic things like links or headings. I couldn't talk to the designer, so I'd have to spend a lot of development time doing design work to fill in the gaps, and I'd resent every minute I spent building it. It meant I couldn't produce the quality of work that I was striving for.</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> I should have learnt more about the project and what I'd be working on before jumping in. I now don't work for agencies unless I can work alongside the designer, and I encourage them to produce and maintain a <a href="https://24ways.org/2011/front-end-style-guides/">styleguide</a>.</p>

<h2>Hosting</h2>

<p><strong>Mistake:</strong> I used to offer hosting alongside web services. I was getting lots of calls outside work hours about problems with hosting, or I'd be spending a lot of time chasing up clients every time their domain name or hosting was due for renewal.</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> I moved clients away from my reseller account and decided to not manage client hosting. I set them up with their own accounts which they manage the billing for.</p>
