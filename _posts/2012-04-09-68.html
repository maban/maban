<p>At the moment I'm refreshing an old site and adapting some code I wrote 3 years ago. A few of the pages have lists of teasers to full articles which are displayed in a grid. They use nth-of-type to remove margins off every 3rd block on a row, and clear the block after that.</p>

<div class="full">

</div>

<p>Back then, <a href="http://maban.co.uk/29">I did a write-up of this technique</a>. It's a little ropey and basic, but I've adapted the code since.</p>

<p>A while ago I bought a big screen to plug into my laptop, and it's been a real eye-opener. It makes some sites look like when you're using a tablet and a mobile version of the site is being displayed. So I've been updating my nth-of-type code, using it to change the number of blocks displayed in a row depending on the width of the screen.</p>

<p><a href="http://jsbin.com/iqiziv/edit">Have a look at the demo in jsbin if you want to try it out</a>.</p>

<p>This code isn't perfect and I'm still tweaking it, but I just want to document it in case someone else finds it useful.</p>

<p>The HTML is just an ordered list like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ol class="teasers"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Donec odio. Quisque volutpat mattis eros. Nullam malesuada erat ut turpis. Suspendisse urna nibh, viverra non, semper suscipit, posuere a, pede.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Donec nec justo eget felis facilisis fermentum. Aliquam porttitor mauris sit amet orci. Aenean dignissim pellentesque felis.&lt;/li&gt;
    &hellip;
&lt;/ol&gt;</code></pre>

<p>I've given the list a class of "teasers" to distinguish it from any other ordered lists on the site. At the moment, I'm just going to build a linearised version with the blocks spanning the full width of the screen. This means sites that don't understand media queries will always just display the linearised version. I'll give them a bit of colour too so I can see what's happening.</p>

<pre><code>.teasers {
    margin:0;
    padding:0;
    }

.teasers li {
    background-color: #333;
    color: #eee;
    float: left;
    clear: none;
    margin-right: 2%;
    margin-bottom: 1em;
    border-radius: 0.2em;
    padding: 1em 2%;
    width:96%
    }</code></pre>

<p>Now I'm going to start adding some media queries, first for a width of more than 400px. (I'm using px for demonstration but <a href="http://blog.cloudfour.com/the-ems-have-it-proportional-media-queries-ftw/">you may want to consider using ems instead</a>).</p>

<pre><code>@media (min-width:400px) {  

.teasers li {
    width: 45%;
    }

.teasers li:nth-of-type(2n+2) {
    margin-right: 0;
    }

.teasers li:nth-of-type(2n+3) {
    clear: both;
    }

}</code></pre>

<p>I've given all the list items a width of 45% which sits them in a 2 column grid, and on the second block of every row, I've removed the margin-right using <code>nth-of-type(2n+2)</code> so it's flush with the right hand edge. I've also forced the block that comes after that to go onto the next line using <code>nth-of-type(2n+3)</code>. This only adds up to 90%, but I already gave a padding of 2% to each side, and the first block on each column has a margin-right of 2%, which adds up to 100%.</p>

<p>That looks good, but now I want to make a 3 column grid if the width gets bigger than 800px.</p>

<pre><code>@media (min-width:800px) {

.teasers li,
.teasers li:nth-of-type(2n+2),
.teasers li:nth-of-type(2n+3) {
    width: 28%;
    float: left;
    clear: none;
    margin-right: 2%;
    }

.teasers li:nth-of-type(3n+3) {
    margin-right: 0;
    }

.teasers li:nth-of-type(3n+4) {
    clear: both;
    }	

}</code></pre>

<p>Now all blocks have a width of 28%. I've also specified <code>nth-of-type(2n+2)</code> and <code>nth-of-type(2n+3)</code> to override the styles I gave them in the previous media query block. Pretty much the same deal going on here except now I'm targeting every 3rd block to remove the margin-right, and every block after the 3rd block to force it to clear.</p>

<pre><code>@media (min-width:1200px) {

.teasers li,
.teasers li:nth-of-type(2n+2),
.teasers li:nth-of-type(2n+3),
.teasers li:nth-of-type(3n+3),
.teasers li:nth-of-type(3n+4) {
    width: 22%;
    float: left;
    clear: none;
    margin-right: 1.29%;
    padding: 1em 1%
    }

.teasers li:nth-of-type(4n+4) {
    margin-right: 0;
    }

.teasers li:nth-of-type(4n+5) {
    clear: both;
    }	

}</code></pre>

<p>It goes on like this, but I've tweaked the margin-right and the padding to a lower number because it was looking a bit gappy. It doesn't add up exactly to 100% because browsers sometimes rounds numbers weirdly and that causes the grid to break, so I try and keep it just under.</p>

<p>Of course, the usual disclaimers about browser compatibility and the fact that this code is still my work in progress, but I can see this working great on a site that has product listings.</p>
