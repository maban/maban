title: British Band Instrument Company

<p>The British Band Instrument Company website was launched as an online brochure of instruments being sold to across the world, specifically in the Middle East.  I added a translation feature, and made all the text editable so it could be translated into different languages.</p>

<p>After some research, I placed the navigation on the right rather than the left because people in the Middle East read from right to left.  I also added images onto the buttons (using the &#8220;<a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/slidingdoors2/">sliding doors</a>&#8220; technique) so that the user could visually distinguish the instruments.  I used the sliding doors technique to speed up load time and ensured the site was usable on IE6 at a screen resolution of 800&#215;600, as I anticipated that many users in this part of the world would not have fast Internet speeds or high-end technology.</p>
