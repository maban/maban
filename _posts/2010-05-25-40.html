<p>On the 19th of May, I gave a talk at Carsonified&#8217;s Future of Web Design London on Freelancing. <s>I&#8217;ve just been sent <a href="https://vimeo.com/11872902">the video of my talk</a> if you missed it.</s> &#8211; Video no longer available. :(</p>

<p>Although I was really nervous in the days leading up to the conference, I really enjoyed speaking. The audience was great, and made such lovely comments on Twitter. I really hope Carsonified ask me to speak again. (hint hint!)</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be posting a write-up of the talk on either my blog or Scrunchup, so keep an eye on my RSS or Twitter feed.</p>
