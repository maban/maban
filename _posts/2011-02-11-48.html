title: Starting out in the Big Wide Web
---

<p>The audio for <a href="https://maban.co.uk/46">my talk at Heart and Sole</a> has been published. I spoke about starting out in the industry, discussing my experience of setting up, and some of the mistakes I made along the way. I also talk about stuff like contracts, finance and getting your first clients.</p>

<p>The audio at the beginning is a bit borked but it sorts itself out after the first minute. I hope you find it useful!</p>
