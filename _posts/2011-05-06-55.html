title: This changes everything

<p>This week I&#8217;ve been planning Hackasaurus workshop venues. I&#8217;ve been looking for IT suites in schools and libraries where I can hold hour long workshops teaching kids how to remix the web using the Hackasaurus tools such as the <a href="https://secure.toolness.com/webxray/">X-Ray Goggles</a> and <a href="http://htmlpad.org/"><span class="caps">HTML</span>pad</a>.</p>

<p>These tools work in modern browsers, but not old versions of IE. This means most public venues aren&#8217;t suitable because their network restricts them from using a different browser. A lot of networks also block certain sites, including Scrunchup, and some even block the &#8220;view source&#8221; feature.</p>

<blockquote>Even more distressing was that we couldn&#8217;t even show kids the power of View Source, because that feature was actually disabled on the library&#8217;s computers.</blockquote>

<p>I think this not an insignificant factor as to <a href="http://royalsociety.org/Current-ICT-and-Computer-Science-in-schools/">why kids are being turned off IT in schools</a>. From my own experience I can remember dozens of times when lessons have been complete write-offs because of some restriction with the network, such as a video we were going to watch being blocked, or not being able to use some cool open source software on the off-chance it infected the network with viruses.</p>

<p>To bring these Hackasaurus workshops into schools, my options are bringing a suitcase full of netbooks and 3G dongles to each workshop, which would be prohibitively expensive, or hoping that I can run a browser from a <span class="caps">USB</span> stick (which <a href="http://www.toolness.com/wp/2011/03/three-lessons-learned-from-hack-jams/">in Atul&#8217;s experience</a>, didn&#8217;t work).</p>

<p>Last week, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-13292450"><span class="caps">BBC</span> news did a report on the Raspberry Pi</a>. It&#8217;s a very low-cost <span class="caps">USB</span> computer being developed by a British non-profit in an effort to promote computer science in schools.</p>

<p>The size of the computer means it&#8217;s much more portable than a netbook, and the price makes it easily replaceable if it gets lost. Schools could make huge savings not having to renew their IT suites every few years, and at &pound;15, the computers are the same price as a scientific calculator.</p>

<p>The device has had a <a href="http://community.tes.co.uk/forums/t/487048.aspx?PageIndex=1">mixed reception</a> from IT teachers, but generally a positive response with a few questions about feasibility.</p>

<p>Here are the specs as of May 2011:</p>
<ul>
	<li>700MHz ARM11</li>
	<li>128MB of <span class="caps">SDRAM</span></li>
	<li>OpenGL ES 2.0</li>
	<li>1080p30 H.264 high-profile decode</li>
	<li>Composite and <span class="caps">HDMI</span> video output</li>
	<li><span class="caps">USB</span> 2.0</li>
	<li>SD/MMC/SDIO memory card slot</li>
	<li>General-purpose I/O</li>
	<li>Open software (Ubuntu, Iceweasel, KOffice, Python)</li>
</ul>

<p>It&#8217;s not going to be top-of-the-range with only 128MB of <span class="caps">RAM</span>, but no doubt later versions will be able to cram even more in if required. Or maybe they&#8217;ll make it so you can connect 2 together. That&#8217;d be nice.</p>

<p>The small storage size would encourage schools to move as much as they can over to &#8220;the cloud&#8221; and make use of web apps (another cost saving).</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t the first of such device to come out. A games console called <a href="http://rossum.posterous.com/20131601">Rbox</a> was developed last year, and is even cheaper than the Raspberry Pi. Then there&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10309116">One Laptop Per Child</a> project which is going strong.</p>

<p>When it&#8217;s out, I plan on buying a couple of dozen and pre-installing a browser to use in our workshops.</p>
