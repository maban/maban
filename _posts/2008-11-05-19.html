<p>The Portland Arms pub website was commissioned by the landlady to provide information to locals about events at the pub, as well as an up-to-date seasonal menu.  The pub dog, Buster, updates his <a href="https://www.theportlandarmspub.co.uk/blog/bustersblog.html">online blog</a> with his perspective of life at the Portland Arms, with photos of the people, and other dogs, he meets.</p>

<p>The landlady takes photos using her iPhone of the food served in the kitchen and uploads them to the website via Flickr.  She also takes photos at special events, and these are automatically posted to <a href="https://www.theportlandarmspub.co.uk/gallery.php">a slideshow on the site</a>.  Many locals didn&#8217;t know where the pub was, so I added a Google map which shows users where the pub is, and they can plan their route to the pub using this feature. </p>
