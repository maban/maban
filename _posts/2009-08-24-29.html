title: Using nth-of-type to create grid blocks that clear
---

<figure class="full">
    <img src="/image/diagram-nth-of-type-01.png" alt="grid blocks demonstrating that if some have more content than others, some block wrap, but others get stuck" />
    <figcaption>So this is what happens if the content in some blocks is longer than others.  Yeugh.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Problem: You want to create a grid based layout with floats, but you don&#8217;t want to wrap things in extraneous divs to force blocks to clear properly.</p>

<p>In an ideal world, all the content is the same height, and blocks will float and clear properly.  But this is not an ideal world.</p>

<figure class="full">
    <img src="/image/diagram-nth-of-type-02.png" alt="grid blocks where the content overlaps a block that has a fixed-height" />
    <figcaption>We could specify the height, but this is a really bad idea.  You can&#8217;t guarantee that the content in the blocks will always be the same height, and you&#8217;ll get ugly overlaps if you&#8217;re wrong.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>One way of achieving this is by wrapping a div round the first three blocks which clears the content above. But this means adding extraneous divs to your markup, and can't always be done easily in a <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr>.</p>

<h2>nth-of-type to the rescue!</h2>

<p>If we know how many blocks are going to be in each row, we can tell which ones to clear using the nth-of-type selector.</p>

<p>So this code clears the 4th, 7th and 10th block</p>

<pre>
	<code>.block:nth-of-type(4),
.block:nth-of-type(7),
.block:nth-of-type(10) {
  clear: both;
}</code>
</pre>

<p>And this code adds margins onto every first and second block in a row.  (You can probably think of a more streamlined way of doing this if you&#8217;re better at maths than me!)</p>

<pre>
	<code>.block:nth-of-type(1),
.block:nth-of-type(2),
.block:nth-of-type(4),
.block:nth-of-type(5),
.block:nth-of-type(7),
.block:nth-of-type(8),
.block:nth-of-type(10),
.block:nth-of-type(11) {
  margin-right:40px;
}</code>
</pre>

<figure class="full">
    <img src="/image/diagram-nth-of-type-04.png" alt="example of the correct blocks clearing" />
    <figcaption>Now we&#8217;ve got the correct grid blocks clearing. Yay!</figcaption>

<h3>Browser Compatibility:</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.quirksmode.org/css/contents.html">not many browsers currently support this</a>.  Firefox 3.1+, Safari 4.0, Chrome, Konqueror, and Opera (albeit incorrectly).  But if you&#8217;ve got a high proportion of users on these browsers, you can have a go at implementing this and get it to degrade quite nicely.</p>
