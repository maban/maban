title: Firefox on a stick

<p>I ran my first UK Hackasaurus workshop on Friday at the University of Birmingham for the <a href="https://www.computingatschool.org.uk/index.php?id=conf2011">Computing at School teacher conference</a>. Most of the attendees were <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> teachers from secondary/high schools, and the session was designed to be adapted by teachers for use in lessons.</p>

<p>It was a really popular topic; the room I had was completely full, to the extent that some people were sitting on the floor, and a group of others stayed the whole 45 minutes listening in at the door.</p>

<p>The workshop, How to Hack the Web, was an introduction to the <a href="https://hackasaurus.org/tools">Hackasaurus tools</a>. We started off by installing the <a href="https://hackasaurus.org/goggles/">X-Ray Goggles</a> and inspecting the <span class="caps">HTML</span> on the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education/"><span class="caps">BBC</span> News website (the education section)</a>. We then used the Goggles to change the text in the headlines, before tearing out the code and putting it in the <a href="https://htmlpad.org/">WebPad</a>. I then showed the participants how to edit the code collaboratively, and extract bits of code from the Hackbook.</p>

<p>The day before the workshop, I&#8217;d found out about an app called <a href="https://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable">Portable Firefox</a>. This let me launch a customised version of Firefox from a <span class="caps">USB</span> stick.</p>

<p>A lot of schools only have an old version of <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr> installed on their computers, and this makes it really difficult to run the workshop because the Hackasaurus tools only work on modern browsers. Some schools won&#8217;t allow teachers to install new software in case it infects their network, and asking the participants to download the software during the workshop would have taken up a lot of time and I wasn&#8217;t sure what the network speeds would be like. Being able to give out pre-installed browsers on sticks worked like a charm, so I&#8217;ll definitely be doing this again.</p>

<p><a href="https://clearleft.com">Clearleft</a> very kindly lent me an armful of <span class="caps">USB</span> sticks to use for the workshop. I set Hackasaurus as the homepage, the bookmark bar to always display, and installed the bookmarklet. When Portable Firefox is launched, the browser already has all the preferences I&#8217;ve set.</p>

<p>The only problem I can foresee is if I took the sticks into a school and they had different proxy settings, or firewalls that prevented students from using the software. I&#8217;ve also heard of some schools and libraries that physically block <span class="caps">USB</span> ports for data protection, so I&#8217;m still trying to think of ways round scenarios like this.</p>
