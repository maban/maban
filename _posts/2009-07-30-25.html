title: HTML5 fix for IE
---

<p>I&#8217;ve been rebuilding my site in HTML5 as a practice run for future projects to see what problems I come across.  When I tested my site in IE, I noticed all the elements that the browser didn&#8217;t recognise were not styled with the <span class="caps">CSS</span>.  After a little bit of searching, I came across <a href="http://remysharp.com/2009/01/07/html5-enabling-script/">this fix by Remy</a> that resolved the issues I was having.  I just thought I&#8217;d share it with you in case you came across the same problem when making the transition to HTML5.</p>
