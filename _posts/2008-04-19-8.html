title: Highlights of FOWD '08
---

<p>Future of web design is a conference hosted by Carsonified.  The speakers are all influential designers, specialising in fields such as User Experience and Branding.  This year&#8217;s event took place from the 16th to the 18th of April.</p>

<p>As much as I&#8217;d like to, I&#8217;m not going to write a minute-by-minute account of the Future Of Web Design conference.  I&#8217;m suffering from the side-effects of writing 300 pages for my IT coursework and I&#8217;m not sure how much more I can type before my swollen fingers drop off.  So I&#8217;m going to summarise a few of the good and not so good events of the 3 days.</p>

<ul>

	<li>Enduring the boys singing Celine Dion songs</li>

	<li>Saying a very sad farewell to the boys :(</li>
</ul>

<p>I really enjoyed my FOWD experience, and can&#8217;t wait for the next event. Here are <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/anna_debenham/sets/72157604619048094/">a few photos</a> that I took.</p>

<p>At first, I wasn't sure If I should go because I'm not a full-time designer yet, and at over Â£100 (plus hotel, food and travel costs), it wasn't cheap.  But I would really recommend it, especially to people like me who don't have much of a chance to interact with other designers.  It's very ineffective and boring to try and learn everything from a book, and I came back feeling very motivated and inspired.</p>
