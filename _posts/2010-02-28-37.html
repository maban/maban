    <figcaption>Here&#8217;s a picture someone drew when the supply teacher we were assigned that day entered the classroom and announced &#8220;Funtime is over.&#8221;</figcaption>

<p>Today, while doing a bit of sorting through old stuff, I stumbled across some pages from notebooks I&#8217;d kept during my time at secondary school.  The notebooks are part of a series I contributed to with my friends.  I think there are about 4 or 5 in total, I have one, my friends have the others.  I guess this was my first open source project.  Everyone in my small group of friends contributed to them, writing, and sometimes drawing what happened throughout the day.</p>

<p>Most of the pictures annotate conversation threads, but on one page there is a collaborative abstract drawing. In some, we used different coloured pens to show the branches the picture takes.</p>

	<figcaption>We refer to another supply teacher as &#8220;the woman who shouts&#8221;.</figcaption>

<p>The themes vary wildly from dinosaurs, to reasons we hate a particular subject, to various ways the faulty science equipment will kill us.  There&#8217;s even a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_Bunny_Suicides">bunny suicide</a> themed section on what form of suicide would be better than reading poetry in a double English lesson.  (All very light-humoured, we weren&#8217;t that emo!)</p>

<p>I went on to create my first website for my friends with a guestbook and visitor counter which was an extension of the sketchbooks, and as a result of the books getting confiscated a number of times.  Unfortunately, the place I hosted my site (freewebs!) was eventually blocked by the Great Firewall of RM, which encouraged me to seek alternatives and build a real website using HTML with a forum and chatroom.</p>

<p>Not long after, I began making sites for other people and by the start of A-Levels, I&#8217;d quit my weekend job and was building sites whenever I wasn&#8217;t at school.</p>

<p>And to think it all started with some doodles in a sketchbook. </p>
